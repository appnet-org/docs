# AppNet Documentation

This repository contains the source code for appnet.wiki

## Quick Start
1. Install mdbook:
```bash
# You need to install Rust first
cargo install mdbook
```

2. Work on your documentation while having an http server for it on
localhost:3000, rebuilding on change.
```bash
mdbook serve
```

3. Build the book and open a browser to view the result:
```
mdbook build -o
```
